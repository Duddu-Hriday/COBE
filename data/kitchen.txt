0	reliability is the issue tragically , i 've decreed more than my share of foodsaver products , having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage , despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers what many of them claim is very much to the point plastic containers frequently develop cracks and loss of vacuum i 've had many of their marinators and storage canisters prove defective after less than 10 uses it seems to be related to the material properties and container size characteristics the smaller containers seem to last stronger those with thick walls relative to the specified volume or reinforcing structures seem to last just a bit longer in plain language , the plastic containers are reliability foodsaver shoud develop corporeal and design that can deals the stress of the vacuum cycling placed on them , or quit the the businesses since their products have been on the market for many years , i can only assume they are more interested in recruiting new customers than heartening existing recipients if you iove filling out warranty way any few weekend , more energy to you bottle sealers are equally pointless any one that i bought lost vacuum in short order in one case , a flawed sealing resulted in a spilled of cooking oils that harm a nylon tents and other camps quicken foodsaver enjoys accomplished a good job with certain subjects in their product bloodline the vacuum unit is well designed and performs reliably , as long as the instuctions are followed the bagging system is unassailable , even though the cost of the bags and rolls is quite high \( read consumer reports reviews \) and , to be fair , their universal lids are excellent use them to seal small glass jars or stainless steel bowls , and there is no loss of vacuum due to cracked plastic bottom line \? be careful which products you buy some are excellent , while others are pure junk

1	magnifique product for whole grain bread and muffins if you like to bake this is a nice product to ont in your arsenal of tools i bake whole grain muffins and breads every week and find this pan to be immeasurably usefulness the breads that i have made released easily after they had cooled i find it best to place this pan on a cooling rack for about an hour before removing the bread from the pans if you do this it releases completely if the bread is still warm when you try to remove it , it might not come out in one piece i have found that it is most to put this pan on a half sheet pan prior to filling it with dough or batter if you try to carry it to the oven without a pan underneath it , it is not very steady if you do n't have other silicone bakeware you are unfamiliar with the nicest feature of this product you can squish it up in a ball to store it , and bounces back to its original shape when you need it my only complaints about this pan is that the bread does not brown as well on the bottom as sides as it does in a metal pan but , being able to make 6 medium sized loaves at one time more than makes up for decrease in browning
1	i'm the baker i love to bake i really love to bake bread my specialty is sourdough so now i have 3 strikes against me , that is , until i found la cloche although it can be used to cook meats , i personally only use it for bread la cloche rotated your regular oven into a brick oven , and the quality of your bread will dumbfounded you it browns beautifully , has a doughy , chewy crust that seems to carmelize the sugars in the crust differently there is no need to spray water or create steam in the oven , because the steam is created inside la cloche by the bread itself so actually bread making is more simple and safe because you are not spraying water into a 500 degree oven there are 2 shapes , a french bread style and round oven hearth style i have both and pop them into the oven at the same time , so i am baking 2 loaves of bread at once , which is a little more economical truly , i wish i had this from the beginning of my baking attempts if you are a baker or love one , go ahead and spring for it you will never mourns this kitchen tool all my other bread saucepans are now unused

0	dangerous ! know not procuring this model ! i have a lot of experience with steamers over the years mine as well as others used in stores stupid me , then , for not realizing that you get what you pay for my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years , but it served me well it is a machine of substance , solid parts , very stable trust me you do n't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam ! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh , and i'm returning it immediately the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep not deep enough to keep the pole stable the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended are n't firm any heavy jacket will make them slide the housing itself is amazingly lightweight i thought that was a bonne thing , but now i know why the jiffy steamer 's housing seems like it weighs a ton you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored handling a steamer is a serious matter do n't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive , poorly designed , lightweight steamer like the conair spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years jiffy you wo n't regret it and even though mine died after nine years , i have no regrets , and now i 'll do the right thing and get another

1	pre seasoned is a plus , but not necessary fabulous oven ! this dutch oven is a workhorse in my kitchen i purchased it pre seasoned because i 've never had a factory seasoned piece of cast iron cookware bottom line while the pre seasoning was a plus , it 's not necessary just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the lodge cookware , and you 'll be fine my family has had cast iron for generations , and i wo n't pay the exhorbitant prices for those upscale , professional dutch ovens that are all the rage these days this lodge oven browns spectacularly , and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one , that 's not a problem if one simply uses one 's nose we can all tell when enough is enough i particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which are n't present on the more expensive ones these spikes tolerated condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and i do n't recieve to alarmed about a dry product the lid on this oven also aligns the 12 inch skillet which i own , and that 's a plus it conducts heat well and when i use it camping as an oven , breads and biscuits come out as well as at home yes , it 's heavy , but that 's the nature of cast iron , no \? \? if you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this lodge piece , be prepared to shell out big bucks

1	a gargantuan teeny press ! i purchased this press to supplement a larger 8 cup model the press allows just under one standard size mug to be filled if you also are looking for a mug 's worth of coffee , i would recommend purchasing the 4 cup model as that would leave just a bit more room , and keep more of the small grindings in the press , rather than in the bottom of my cup also , it should be noted that bodum sells the spare parts for this press \( right here on amazon , in fact \) , so if you should break it , a few dollars will get you back in java ! another note , some people have mentioned that dumping the grindings proves problematic as you ca n't just put them down the drain \( plugs up your trap \) i have found an easy solution in using the plastic and wire mesh grind basket of my last automatic coffee maker as a strainer i just pour the bit of water and grinds out of the press and into the basket \( which i leave in the sink \) , and allow the water to run off then i pour shake the dry coffee into the trash no fuss , and the basket is dishwasher safe for the occasional cleaning

0	exquisite product as long as you do n't intend to use it this stunning slice of kitchen sew is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream built with quality materials like real metal \( not silvery plastic \) , and sporting a sophisticated , drop dead gorgeous retro appeal it seems equally as impressive in the hippest new york loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of williams sonoma however , as is the case when function follows form , this is a dreaded blender do n't get me wrong i'm more than willing to forgive a modicum of piss poor functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant but quite frankly , this blender is beyond wicked most pitiable is the blender 's propensity to splash everywhere even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand it seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor i suspect that the unit 's quasi industrial motor may be a contributing factor it only supports two speeds off , and jet cyclonic while i admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right , the consequences of omitting ramp up speeds are overbearing , consistently messy , predictably inconvenient , and potentially dangerous \( as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing \) the irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward and the blender 's poorly sealed lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion in fact , this blender splashes so profusely that it 's nearly unusable it 's too bad , because superficially , this blender really is quite the objet d'art but when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance , it has a long way to go even in comparison to a 29 oster if i had to summarize this blender as accurately , succinctly , and fairly as possible , i 'd distill it down to one word regrettable

1	easy clean finish i have the four piece set of these silicone utensils , and have been very excited with them they are heat resistant , heavy duty , and look sharp they are slightly flexible , but i have not found this to be a problem unless you want to do heavy scraping with the turner the best part is the wonderful easy clean properties of the silicone my other heat sturdy utensils systematically blankly icky and need to be scrubbed with a scouring pad to clean the textured finish these look great right out of the dishwasher ! i 've had them for a year and they 've held up great the turner has not obliterated on the edge , either , like many other types do the smooth finish allows food to slip right off without sticking as you 're cooking
